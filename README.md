# Siamese

A Keras implementation of Siamese neural net is provide here as python scripts. 

Convolution and simple dense layer based networks are experimented with.

Siamese architecture and cost function is based on the discussion found in this page: https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/242.

The AT&T face databased is used for testing and downloaded from here: http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html

This dataset was originally used in LeCunn's paper: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/chopra-05.pdf

Also MNIST data in csv form is used. Original source: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
(train.csv couldn't be uploaded due to memory limitation. change the code to test.csv and experiment with that).
